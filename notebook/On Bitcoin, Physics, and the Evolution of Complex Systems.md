# On Bitcoin, Physics, and the Evolution of Complex Systems
 
## Weekend Thoughts: 
Satoshi Nakamoto is to Sir Isaac Newton as, 
Bitcoin is to Newtonian Physics.
 
Specifically, the Bitcoin whitepaper and open source code, is equivalent and as impactful as Newton's publication of Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (c. 1687).  

I think Bitcoin is a fundamental new field of study, a seminal, foundational bedrock.

Newton discovered new math called Calculus, and applied it to moving objects, i.e. Newtonian Physics, the foundation of physics. (Hat tip also to Leibniz, who independently co-discovered calculus, and whose calculus symbols are adopted and used today.)

Newton probably imagined great thinkers adopting and furthering his work, but I don't think he could have *ever* fathomed the impacts.  Great thinkers such as Bernoulli on Fluids, Carnot on Thermodynamics, Ben Franklin on Electricity, Einstein on Relativity, etc.

Bitcoin is like Newtonian Physics, the seed to a new tree of creative crypto innovation, on the darwinian free market, with enormous social positive impacts thru decentralization & separation of money and state. (We must ensure used for good).

Bitcoin is foundational, an element like gold, that solves a fundamental problem: divisible money and store of value thru space *and* time.  Anything that solves the same problem probably won't succeed. There will be 2 things solving the same problem.  Nature will simplify.

Rather than solve the same fundamental problem, I see more domain specific fields of study developing, extending from the first principles.  Complex systems simplify, reach equilibrium, a natural state of low energy.
